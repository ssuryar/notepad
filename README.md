Notepad Application
--------------------------
A note-taking app is like a digital notebook where you can create and store notes. You can jot down text in the app and view it upon returning to the window, editing, or deleting the records if required. The notes are organized according to the dates when users have last opened them.

A notepad project is a classic instance of Angular development in practice. You can build it with NodeJs, Angular CLI, and Bootstrap (using Node Package Manager).
